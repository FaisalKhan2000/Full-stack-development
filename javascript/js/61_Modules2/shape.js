// Importing functions from shape modules
import * as circle from "./shapes/circle.js";
import * as square from "./shapes/square.js";
import * as triangle from "./shapes/traingle.js";

// Exporting all shape functions
export { circle, square, triangle };

// // Another way
// export * as circle from "./shapes/circle.js";
// export * as square from "./shapes/square.js";
// export * as triangle from "./shapes/traingle.js";
